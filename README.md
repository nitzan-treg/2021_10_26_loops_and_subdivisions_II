#  Loops And Subdivisions II
This project is based on Entagma's tutorial: https://entagma.com/loops-subdivisions/
the tutorial teachs how to recursively subdivide and deform geometry.

This is my second take on this subject, you can look at the previous project at the following link [Loops and Subdivions I](https://github.com/nitzan-treg/2021_10_25_loops_and_subdivisions)

The scene is rendered in Mantra.

Animating the Extrude parameters results in an interesting animation
